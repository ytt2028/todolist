Step 1: Set Up Git Repository
1.	Create a new directory for the project:
Open a terminal and run:
mkdir todo-list-app
cd todo-list-app
2.	Initialize a new Git repository:
Inside the todo-list-app directory, initialize Git:
git init
3.	Create a .gitignore file:
This file helps Git ignore specific files or folders. Since you’ll have dependencies saved in node_modules/ (which can get very large), it’s best to exclude them from the repository. This command creates a .gitignore file with node_modules/ listed, so it won’t be tracked by Git.
echo "node_modules/" > .gitignore
Step 2: Verify the setup
•	Once the installation finishes, you should see a bunch of new files in the project directory.
•	To test if everything is set up correctly, start the development server:
•	npm start
•	Run the create-react-app Command
               npx create-react-app .
•	Once the setup is complete,  start the server from the terminal by running:
                        npm start
•	default browser at http://localhost:3000
Step3: install dependencies 
•	for this project use the default dependencies. Later if we like to add new libraries, we can do so with npm install <package-name> 
Step4: Project Structure
•	 1.Create a components folder:
•	Inside the src directory, create a new folder called components. This is where all  React components (individual pieces of the app) will live.
2. Create Component Files:
•	Inside src/components/, create the following component files:
o	TodoItem.js: This component will represent a single to-do item.
o	TodoList.js: This component will render a list of TodoItem components.
o	AddTodo.js: This component will contain the form to add new to-do items.
Step 5: Develop the Application Components
1.App component(App.js)
Purpose: This is the main component of the app, holding the to-do data and the logic for managing tasks (adding, editing, deleting, marking as completed).
Code Breakdown:
•	useState: This React hook creates the todos state, which stores the list of tasks. setTodos is used to update this list whenever a task is added, edited, deleted, or marked as completed.
•	Functions:
o	addTodo function: Adds a new task to the existing todos list and updates the state.
o	toggleComplete function: Changes the completion status of a task by toggling the completed property.
o	deleteTodo function: Removes a task from the todos list by filtering it out based on the task’s index.
o	editTodo function: Updates the text of a specific task in the todos list.
Components inside:
•	<AddTodo />: A form component for adding new tasks to the list.
•	<TodoList />: A component for displaying all tasks in the todos list.
In Summary: The App component controls the data and functions for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. It passes these as props to child components (AddTodo and TodoList).
2. AddTodo Component (AddTodo.js)
Purpose: This component is a form that lets users type a new task and add it to the list.
Code Breakdown:
•	useState: Creates a state variable newTodo to store the text of the new task as the user types.
•	handleSubmit function:
o	Prevents page refresh: Calls e.preventDefault() to stop the form submission from refreshing the page.
o	Adds the new task: If newTodo isn’t empty, it uses the addTodo function from App to add the new task.
o	Clears input: Resets newTodo to an empty string after the task is added, clearing the input box.
In Summary: The AddTodo component manages user input for new tasks and updates the App component with new tasks while resetting the input form.


Certainly! I’ll format the code breakdown in a similar style for clarity. Here’s the detailed explanation for each component in the to-do list app:
 
1. App Component (App.js)
Purpose: This is the main component of the app, holding the to-do data and the logic for managing tasks (adding, editing, deleting, marking as completed).
Code Breakdown:
•	useState: This React hook creates the todos state, which stores the list of tasks. setTodos is used to update this list whenever a task is added, edited, deleted, or marked as completed.
•	Functions:
o	addTodo function: Adds a new task to the existing todos list and updates the state.
o	toggleComplete function: Changes the completion status of a task by toggling the completed property.
o	deleteTodo function: Removes a task from the todos list by filtering it out based on the task’s index.
o	editTodo function: Updates the text of a specific task in the todos list.
Components inside:
•	<AddTodo />: A form component for adding new tasks to the list.
•	<TodoList />: A component for displaying all tasks in the todos list.
In Summary: The App component controls the data and functions for adding, editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. It passes these as props to child components (AddTodo and TodoList).
 
2. AddTodo Component (AddTodo.js)
Purpose: This component is a form that lets users type a new task and add it to the list.
Code Breakdown:
•	useState: Creates a state variable newTodo to store the text of the new task as the user types.
•	handleSubmit function:
o	Prevents page refresh: Calls e.preventDefault() to stop the form submission from refreshing the page.
o	Adds the new task: If newTodo isn’t empty, it uses the addTodo function from App to add the new task.
o	Clears input: Resets newTodo to an empty string after the task is added, clearing the input box.
In Summary: The AddTodo component manages user input for new tasks and updates the App component with new tasks while resetting the input form.
 
3. TodoList Component (TodoList.js)
Purpose: This component receives the list of tasks from App and renders each task as a TodoItem component.
Code Breakdown:
•	todos.map: Loops through the todos list and creates a TodoItem for each task. Each task gets its own TodoItem component.
•	key: Each TodoItem receives a unique key (here, index) to help React track changes and improve performance.
In Summary: TodoList serves as a container for TodoItem components, ensuring each task in the list is displayed as a separate item.
4. TodoItem Component (TodoItem.js)
Purpose: This component represents an individual task. It displays the task’s text, a checkbox for marking it as completed, and buttons for editing or deleting the task.
Code Breakdown:
•	useState for Editing:
o	isEditing: Controls whether the task is in edit mode (where the text can be modified) or view mode.
o	editedText: Holds the updated text while editing.
•	Functions:
o	toggleComplete: Toggles the completed status of the task by calling the toggleComplete function passed as a prop from App.
o	handleEdit: Switches the task into edit mode.
o	handleSave: Saves the edited text by calling editTodo, exits edit mode, and updates the task text.
•	Elements:
o	input type="checkbox": A checkbox representing whether the task is completed, where checked is set to todo.completed.
o	span and input: Displays the task text as a span when not editing, or an editable input field when in edit mode.
In Summary: TodoItem manages individual tasks, allowing users to mark them as complete, edit the text, or delete the task entirely.
